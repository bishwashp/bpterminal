# Linux Terminal-Inspired Website Requirements Document

## Project Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a personal website with a Linux terminal-inspired interface. The website will serve primarily as a blog and professional presence, featuring content sections including About Me, Projects, Contact, and Blog. The design will maintain a consistent terminal aesthetic throughout while offering modern functionality and fluid user experience.

## Design Requirements

### Visual Design
1. **Terminal Aesthetic**
   - The entire website should maintain a Linux terminal look and feel
   - Default color scheme: Classic green text on black background
   - User-customizable primary and secondary colors
   - Consistent terminal styling across all pages

2. **Typography**
   - Primary font: SF Mono
   - Alternative options: Selection of monospaced sans-serif typefaces from Google Fonts
   - User-customizable font selection

3. **Layout**
   - Homepage: Terminal-like welcome screen with command prompt
   - Content pages: Focus on page content while maintaining terminal aesthetic
   - Perfect alignments for all elements across all pages
   - Persistent floating command bar at the bottom of every page

4. **Animations & Effects**
   - Fluid, minimal animations throughout
   - Typing effects where appropriate
   - Cursor blinking effect
   - Smooth transitions between pages and states

5. **Navigation Indicator**
   - Persistent "i" icon on every page
   - Page navigation menu fades in/out on hover over the "i" icon

## Functional Requirements

### Terminal Interface
1. **Command Input**
   - Functional command prompt on homepage
   - Persistent command bar at the bottom of all other pages
   - Support for standard Linux commands for navigation (`ls`, `cd`, `cat`, etc.)
   - Command validation with error messages for invalid inputs

2. **Command Features**
   - Command history (up/down arrow keys to cycle through previous commands)
   - Tab completion functionality
   - Predictive text suggestions (gray text indicating most appropriate option)

3. **Navigation System**
   - Command-based navigation between sections
   - Intuitive commands that match content (e.g., `cd about` to navigate to About page)
   - Guide/help section explaining available commands
   - Error handling for invalid navigation attempts

### Content Sections

1. **Home Page**
   - Welcome message
   - Brief introduction
   - Quick guide for using the terminal interface
   - Command prompt as primary interaction method

2. **About Me Section**
   - Personal/professional information
   - Bio/background
   - Skills and expertise
   - Command guide for website navigation

3. **Projects Section**
   - Showcase of professional projects
   - Project descriptions, technologies used, outcomes
   - Links to external project resources where applicable

4. **Blog Section**
   - Collection of blog posts/articles
   - Date-sorted entries
   - Category/tag system
   - Terminal-styled blog post display

5. **Contact Section**
   - Contact form with fields for:
     - Name
     - Email
     - Subject
     - Message
   - Form validation
   - Submission handling to forward entries to personal email

## Technical Requirements

   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Mobile-friendly interface

### Development Approach
1. **Frontend Technology**
   - Technology stack optimized for fluid, smooth animations
   - Clean, maintainable code structure
   - Modular components for easier maintenance

2. **Third-Party Integrations**
   - Email service integration for contact form
   - Additional integrations as necessary without impacting performance

### User Customization
1. **Theme Options**
   - Color scheme customization (primary and secondary colors)
   - Font selection from available monospace options
   - Persistent user preferences (stored locally)

## Additional Features

   - Sufficient color contrast

3. **Error Handling**
   - Informative error messages for invalid commands
   - Terminal-style error display
   - Suggestions for correct commands when errors occur

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Code Generation**
   - Requirements designed to be comprehensive for LLM code generation
   - Clear structure to facilitate accurate code output
   - Detailed specifications to minimize ambiguity

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize external dependencies
   - Optimize asset loading
   - Consider code splitting for faster initial load

3. **Future Extensibility**
